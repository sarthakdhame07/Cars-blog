        <br>
        <h1>Rust in peace to the Dream Cars of the Car Guys</h1>
    </header>
   <p class="info">We're nearing the end of 2023 and automakers have already rolled out most of their new products for next year. That <br>means many of the cars, trucks, and SUVs that we love so much won't make it to 2024.
    <br><br>
    Luxury brands like Audi and Mercedes-Benz are putting multiple cars to rest as they prep new products,while American <br> automakers like Chrysler and Dodge have at least one vehicle going the way of the dodo as they prep for the upcoming EV <br>onslaught.Even a few supercars won’t stick around next year, some destined to be replaced by more powerful models.
    <br><br>
    More cars will join this list next year. For now, let's say our goodbyes and remember those vehicles we've lost.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="Audi">:-Audi R8</p>
    <div class="R8">
        <img src="R8.jpg">
        <p>On the 23rd of March 2024, the last Audi supercar of the ICE age rolled out of Böllinger Höfe. TopGear UK witnessed this imminent heart-wrenching end of an era. The original plan was to kill the R8 in 2023 but Audi held on to this mid-engine V10-powered screamer for one more year. God help us that our generation had to witness the demise of Iron-Man and now the car that has been associated with the fictional yet super-philanthropist.<br><br>

            The R8 was Audi's halo car for decades and was well-appreciated as a practical supercar around the globe. It all started with the Audi Le Mans Quattro concept, and Audi unbelievably pulled it off, doing true justice to the design. Partnering with Audi saved Lamborghini and even ended up in every Punjabi song of that time. So what did Audi get in return? A 5.2-litre V8 engine, even if it was from the humble Gallardo.<br><br>
            
            Jeremy Clarkson approved that the R8 was the best supercar, without any of the usual drawbacks of a supercar. He even made a hardcore Porsche fanboy like Hammand admit it. Clarkson adored the space and comfort the Audi offered. In particular, the Quattro all-wheel-drive system remained forgiving even during drifts.<br><br>
            
            Having Lamborghini behind their backs, Audi plonked the V10 from the Huracan right in the middle of the R8. Now the sad reality hits us: the soon-to-retire Huracan is the last standing V10 under these brands.<br><br>
            
            Through the 17-year-long run, we saw the Audi R8 GT RWD, we saw Audi's adieu in Japan with an extremely rare 8-unit Final Edition in matte Ibis white, and a couple of more limited editions. Now the last of the last Audi R8 is in Vegas yellow, wearing bronze 20-inch wheels. <br><br>
            
            That said, we are told that this Performance Quattro Edition will neither see a customer nor a red line; instead, it is destined to be showcased in the Ingolstadt Museum. However, this flagship packs a sensational naturally aspirated 5.2-litre V10 producing 612bhp distributed to all four wheels. Even if Audi ever dared to bring back the R8, it would undoubtedly be an electric, hence this is indeed a paradigm shift. One, that we saw coming but weren’t prepared for.

        <p class="charger">:-Dodge Charger</p>
        <div class="dodge">
            <img src="charger.jpg">
            <p class="dodge">
                 The modern muscle car Dodge Charger caused a lot of excitement among fans of the original muscle cars when it was introduced in 2005. Why? Because it had four doors. In January 1999, Dodge presented a red concept called at the Detroit Auto Show. The special feature, apart from the natural gas drive, was that the concept had four doors with a coupe-shaped roof line. The car was ahead of its time in terms of alternative propulsion but otherwise quite unemotional so that it was soon forgotten.<br><br>

                 In 1983, Dodge unveiled a Shelby Charger modified by none other than racing driver and automotive designer Caroll Shelby himself. Featuring an all-around spoiler package, the Shelby was available only in silver or blue, and had different colored stripes all around and once lengthwise. The 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine received a power boost to 107 horsepower, up from the original 94 horsepower. As a result, the 1983 Shelby Charger made it from 0 to 60 mph in just 10 seconds. Interestingly, due to the heavy modifications, the Charger had to be declared as a Shelby model, and the Dodge trademark did not appear anywhere on the car.<br><br>

                 The Dodge Charger is not only the world’s first four-door muscle car, but the 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye with a 797-hp 6.2-liter Hemi V8, is also the fastest production sedan in the world, aside from the newly unveiled 2023 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170. It does the standing sprint to 60 mph (96 km/h) in just 3.6 seconds and the American quarter-mile in 10.6 seconds at 129 mph (207 km/h), reaching an impressive top speed of 203 mph (326 km/h).<br><br>

                 there’s actually no such thing as a Dodge Charger Hybrid. Dodge implemented a clever bit of eye-catching advertising in the ad above in order to make readers aware of the new Charger, which in addition to being a quintessentially American muscle car, features hybrid technology. However, not in the way you expect: instead of saving fuel, it burns both gas and rubber.<br>

        <p class="cheverlate">:- Chevrolet’s Camaro</p>
        <div class="camaro">
            <img  src="camaro.jpg">
            <p>
                The Chevrolet Camaro is one of the most storied and sought-after cars in the history of the automotive industry, and for good reasons. Its power, prestige, features, and options are legendary among all who feel the need for speed. Here, we will dive deeply into the details of the 2023 version of this beast of a coupe.<br><br>
                Eight fantastic trim levels are available for the 2023 Chevrolet Camaro: the 1LS, 1LT, 2LT, 3LT, LT1, 1SS, 2SS, and ZL1. Four extraordinary engines are available to power the 2023 Camaro. The base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder LTG version granting 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The first optional engine is a naturally aspirated 3.6-liter V-6 LGX version providing 335 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque.<br><br>

                The second optional engine is a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V-8 LT1 version generating 455 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. The final optional engine is a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 LT4 version pounding out an impressive 490 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. Three transmissions can be paired with these potent engines: a six-speed manual, an eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters, and a 10-speed automatic. Its drivetrain is rear-wheel regardless of trim level.<br><br>

                The Chevrolet Camaro is well-known for leaving the competition in the dust, and the version available for the 2023 model year is no different. The 2.0-liter engine takes this Camaro from zero to 60 in 5.4 seconds. The V-6 does the same in 5.2 seconds. The naturally aspirated version of the V-8 does it in four seconds.<br><br>

                The ultimate engine option, the supercharged V-8, makes the sprint in a blinding 3.5 seconds. Further performance upgrades available through our service center at Vaden Chevrolet of Pooler, Georgia, can lower the time it takes even further, making this Camaro a blur on the track and the open road alike. The 2023 Camaro is rarely utilized for towing but can be fitted to tow up to 1,000 pounds.<br><br>

                It comes standard with 18-inch 5-split spoked silver-painted aluminum wheels, Blackwall all-season tires, power-adjustable body-colored side mirrors, and variable-speed intermittent windshield wipers with a washing unit. Its exterior options include dark tinted tail lamps, heated auto-dimming versions of the side-view mirrors, run-flat versions of the Blackwall tires, front and rear bowties, a stanchion spoiler, and an upgrade to 20-inch bright five-spoke silver-painted aluminum wheels.

        <p class="Porche">:- Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo</p>
        <div class="panamera">
            <img src="panamera.jpg">
            <P>
                The Porsche Panamera is a mid to full-sized luxury car (E-segment or F-segment for LWB in Europe) manufactured and marketed by German automobile manufacturer Porsche[1][2][3] across three generations using a front-engine, rear or all-wheel drive configuration.<br><br>

                As a front-engine, full-size, four-passenger, four-door luxury hatchback weighing nearly 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg), the Panamera runs contrary to the company's historically lightweight two-door, rear-engine sports cars, notably the 911. Though the Panamera's shape and profile recall the 911,[7] where the 911 has a tight, performance-focused interior, the Panamera features commodious dimensions with technological, luxury-oriented amenities.<br><br>

                The engine of the Panamera Turbo S features larger turbochargers than the standard Panamera Turbo's 4.8-litre V8, as well as high-pressure fuel injection, and aluminium-alloy pistons. The piston rings are coated in a low-friction surface to help eke out even more performance. The Panamera Turbo S accelerates to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.3 seconds with launch control engaged. Roll-on acceleration should be more impressive, changes to the PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) gearbox allow for faster gearshifts, and the alleged 27.7mpg fuel economy is no worse than the less powerful Panamera Turbo.<br>
                Drag Coefficient: 0.30<br>
                0–60 mph (0–97 km/h): 3.3 seconds<br>
                0–100 mph (0–161 km/h): 7.2 seconds<br>
                1/4 mile: 11.5 seconds at 116 mph (187 km/h)<br>
                Braking 70 mph (110 km/h) to 0 mph (0 km/h): 135 feet (41 m)<br>
